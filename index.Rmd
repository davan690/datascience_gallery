In the Spring of 2018, I taught a PSY 607 seminar called *Data Science Methods for Psychology*. This course was indented to introduce students to topics, concepts, and workflows that are commonplace in “data science” more generally but are less formally discussed in Psychology. Each week, a pair of students would lead a tutorial sesson on a given topic before assigning a "mini-hackathon" project for the rest of the class to complete over the coming week. These presentations were consistently excellent, and it would be a shame if I was the only one who got to see them. As such, I thought they might make a useful resource for others in the department (and beyond) who are looking to increase their knowledge of these particular topics or dig in a little deeper with their R skills with relevant information home brewed right here in the UO [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/) by our peers. Additionally on this page, you will also find the custom R package ["psychduck"](psychduck.html) which was collectively created in the class, as well as the course syllabus.   

Below are links to the tutorials created for each topic covered in our course. Enjoy!
